"""Typed domain state for MANDATE.

This is the minimal Phase-1 slice of the ~29 state classes described in the
product spec (§8): enough to represent a country with population groups,
institutions, and a treasury, nest it in a world, and drive a turn resolution.
The remaining classes (`GovernmentState`, `MilitaryState`, `DiplomaticRelationState`,
etc.) are added in the phase that gives them behavior (see `docs/roadmap.md`)
rather than stubbed out empty here.

All models are Pydantic `BaseModel`s with `extra="forbid"` so malformed
scenario/save data fails loudly, and `validate_assignment=True` so in-place
mutation during turn resolution re-checks field-level constraints (value
ranges, non-negativity) as well as construction. Cross-field invariants (e.g.
population-group shares summing to 1.0) are *not* expressible as per-field
constraints and are checked separately by `simulation.invariants`.
