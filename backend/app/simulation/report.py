"""The explainable output of one turn resolution.

Two audiences, kept structurally separate:

- `entries`: player-facing. What actually happened this turn, in terms a
  player can read. Nothing is added here for systems that don't exist yet —
  per the product spec's "no placeholder feature claims" rule (§5.7), an
  unimplemented system produces no player-facing claim about what it did.
- `dev`: developer/test-facing. `phase_statuses` records, for every phase in
  `simulation.phases.PHASE_ORDER`, whether it actually ran real logic this
  session or is still a registered no-op — structured metadata for tests and
  future development tracking, not narrated to the player as 12–15 repetitive
  "nothing happened" report entries.
